          <pre>Simple Storage Service (S3)
S3 is a secure, durable and highly scalable object storage. S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service
interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. This means customers of
all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such
as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT
devices, and big data analytics.
S3 Features:
• It is a global service
• Low latency and high throughput performance
• It is a Safe place to store your files
• It is object based storage
• Durability: AWS claims Amazon S3 to have a 99.999999999% of durability. This means the
possibility of losing your data stored on S3 is one in a billion.
• A single Amazon S3 object can store maximum of 5 terabytes. The total volume that an
s3 bucket can store is unlimited. If an object size is greater than 5 gigabytes, you should
consider multipart upload.
• S3 Bucket Names must be unique globally.
• Lifecycle Management
• Versioning
• Encryption
• Secure Your data using Access Control lists & Bucket Policy
S3 Restrictions and Limitations:
• Bucket ownership is not transferable to another account.
• When we create a bucket, we choose its name and the AWS Region to create it in. After
we create a bucket, we can't change its name or Region.
• By default, we can create up to 100 buckets in each of our AWS accounts. If we need
additional buckets, you can increase our account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000
buckets by submitting a service limit increase. There is no difference in performance
whether you use many buckets or just a few. (Note: Search Service Quotas in AWS)
S3 Bucket Overview:

Versioning:
Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same
bucket. We can use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of
every object stored in our buckets. It is enabled at the bucket level. Versioning- enabled
buckets can help you recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.
