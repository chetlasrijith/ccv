          <pre>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services
and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use
permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM can also keep our account
credentials private.
When we first create an AWS account, it has complete access to all AWS services. This identity
is called the AWS account root user
IAM Features:
Shared access to the AWS account: The main feature of IAM is that it allows you to create
separate usernames and passwords for individual users or resources and delegate access.
Multifactor authentication (MFA): IAM supports MFA, in which users provide their username
and password plus a one-time password from their phone a randomly generated number used
as an additional authentication factor.
Identity Federation: If the user is already authenticated, such as through a Facebook or Google
account, IAM can be made to trust that authentication method and then allow access based on
it.
Free to use: There is no additional charge for IAM security. There is no additional charge for
creating additional users, groups or policies.
Password policy: The IAM password policy allows you to reset a password or rotate passwords
remotely.
Granular permissions: Each user can be granted with different set granular permissions as
required to perform their job

AWS is supporting two types of accounts
1. Root User
2. IAM User
Root User:
• Root Account Credentials are the email address and password with which we sign in into
the AWS account
• Root Credentials has full unrestricted access to AWS account including the account
security credentials which include sensitive information
• An Administrator account can be created for all the activities which too has full access to
the AWS account except the accounts security credentials, billing information and ability
to change password
IAM User:
• IAM user represents the person or service who uses the access to interact with AWS.
• IAM user starts with no permissions and is not authorized to perform any AWS actions
on any AWS resources and should be granted permissions as per the job function
requirement.
• Each IAM user is associated with one and only one AWS account.
• IAM User cannot be renamed from AWS management console and has to be done from
CLI or SDK tools.
Stepsto Create IAM User:
• Create Two IAM user.
• One user will access only EC2 Machines & Second user will access only S3 Buckets.
• Go to IAM
• Click on Users
• Click on Add Users
• Enter the user name
• Select AWS Access Type.
• We can connect our AWS account with 2 ways.
• Console Access (Graphical Access)
• Command Line Interface (CLI)
• Select custom password & enter the password
• Uncheck require password reset
• Click on Next: Permissions
• Click on Attach existing policies directly
• Search the EC2 full Access policy
• Select the policy
• Click on Next: Tags
• Click on Next: Review
• Click on Create user
• Create Another User Given S3 Full Access
• Note down the console ID of your root user
• Go to the AWS URL
• Select IAM User
• Enter the Account ID (Console ID)
• Click on Next
• Enter IAM user name & password
• Click on Sign In
• Change the Password
IAM Groups and Attach Policies:
• An IAM Group is a collection of users. Group specifies the permission for a collection of
users, and it also makes it possible to manage the permissions easily for those users.
• Following are some important characteristics of user groups:
• A user group can contain many users, and a user can belong to multiple user groups.
• User groups can't be nested; they can contain only users, not other user groups.
• There is no default user group that automatically includes all users in the AWS account.
If you want to have a user group like that, you must create it and assign each new user
to it.
• Default Quota is 300 Groups For an AWS Account & Max quota is 500 Groups
Steps to Create Groups and attach Policies:
• Go to IAM
• Click on User groups
• Click on Create Group
• Enter the name of the group
• Attach Permission policies
• Search S3Full Access
• Click on Create Group
• Create new user with Group
• Select AWS Access Type
• Enter password
• Click on Next: Permissions
• Select Add user to group
• Click on Add: Tags
• Click on Create User
• Login with User
• Check the S3 Bucket
• Remove User & Add User in Group
• Create One more Group
• Attach Permissions Policies
• Search EC2 Read only
• Create Group
• Open First Group
• Select the user
• Click on Remove users
• Open Second Group
• Click on Add Users
• Select the user & Click on Add users
• Now check group</pre>
