          <pre>Launch the Amazon Linux Server from AWS and make as Web Server.
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that
from Web pages to users, in response to their request.
Example of Webservers
• Apache HTTP Server
• Internet Information Services (IIS)
• NGINX
• HTTPD by Apache
HTTPD: HTTP Daemon is a software program that runs in the background as a web server. It
waits for the incoming server requests. The daemon answers the request and serves the
hypertext and multimedia documents over the Internet using HTTP.
Linux Web Server:
We will install HTTPD by Apache & it will be the Two Step Process
Step 1: Update the YUM Repository
Step 2: Install Web Package
• Create Linux EC2 Machine
• Connect the Linux EC2 Machine
• Switch User to root
sudo su
• Update the YUM Repository
yum update –y
• Install Web Package
yum install httpd –y
• Move to the html Directory
cd /var/www/html
• Create web Page
echo “Amazon Web Services” > index.html
• Start web package
service httpd
start chkconfig httpd on
• Now, Our Linux machine is webserver.
• Copy the Public IP & paste in Web Browser
• Select our Security group
• Edit Inbound Rules
• Click on Add Rule.
• Change type to HTTP & Source as Anywhere IPV4
• Click on Save rules
• Now Refresh the Web browser
Repository: A Linux repository is a storage location from which your system retrieves and
installs OS updates and applications.
We need to install web package, it is called web server. Package is nothing but software.
YUM Repository: YUM Repositories are warehouses of Linux software. Sometimes the software
we want to install is not available in Linux OS default. In such situations, we can use YUM
Repositories. We can install new software on Linux with “yum install packagename" command
from console.
Launch the Windows Server from AWS and make as Web Server.
